##How to install & run:
 - download/clone
 - run the following commands from the project root directory:
 - `cd react_app/ && npm install && npm start;`
 - `cd ../nodejs_server/ && npm install && node .;`
 - load ./chrome_extension/ as dev mode extension 

I did not implemented  query by user id - did not have enough time due to personal reasons. User Id is stored in server and for each history record a different user Id will be generated
